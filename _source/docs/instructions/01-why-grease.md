title: Keys to drafting powerful comments
---

### Why your comment matters

Federal agencies must consider and respond to significant comments. A
well-written comment can:

- Slow down harmful rules*
- Help prevent bad policies from taking effect
- Make good policies better
- Help set up future challenges
- Point out procedural irregularities

> “An agency must consider and respond to significant comments received
during the period for public comment.”
— Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Ass’n, 575 U.S. 92, 96 (2015)

*Remember: rules can be regulatory or deregulatory actions.
