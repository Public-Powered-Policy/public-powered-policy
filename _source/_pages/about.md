## Origins

We — Rebecca Bond, Eliza Dermody, Cameron Lynch, and Kristin Stitcher — served together in the Civil Rights Division at the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).

At DOJ, we worked in the Disability Rights Section, an office created to protect the rights of people with disabilities. We developed major civil rights regulations, including rules protecting the rights of people with disabilities to have equal access to websites and medical care. 

Rebecca led the Section as Chief for 12 years, filing lawsuits, drafting key civil rights rules, and providing valuable information to people with disabilities, businesses, and state and local governments on their rights and responsibilities (more on each of us below).

After this administration made clear that we were not welcome (for example, Rebecca was abruptly relieved of her leadership responsibilities), we lost confidence that we’d be able to protect the integrity of the law and the rights of people with disabilities. After serving well across multiple administrations, we made the difficult decision to leave the Department.

**Although we left DOJ, we knew our work to protect your rights wasn’t done.** We also saw how those with power were trying to limit your ability to influence the rules and regulations that impact your daily life. Now, we’ve teamed up to use our experience to help the public reclaim its voice in federal rulemaking. We want to spotlight the administration’s attempts to draft harmful rules and to cut you out of the process. 

We want to arm you with the tools you need to ensure your voice is heard. 

## Mission

To strengthen democracy by breaking down barriers to meaningful and widespread public engagement in the regulatory process by spotlighting harms, empowering the public, and reimagining the playing field. 
Basically, we want to let you know how rules impact you, what potentially harmful rules are coming, and how you can get involved and use your voice.

**And hopefully in the long run, we can help make better rules that work for you.**

## Experience

We have been inside the machinery of federal rulemaking and know how it should operate. But too often, industry groups and large corporations push agencies to draft rules that are good for them. Even when they’re not good for you. We know regulations are better when they’re based on feedback from people like you. We want to help you push the government to write rules that work for you.

At DOJ, we protected the rights of millions of people. For example, we:

- Drafted a rule to make state and local government websites accessible so that people with disabilities can use the internet to help them vote, go to college, learn about civic events, and understand what’s happening at their child’s school.
- Drafted a rule to make medical diagnostic equipment, like exam tables, weight scales, and mammography equipment, accessible. This rule will help people in their everyday lives by requiring doctors to have accessible equipment, like scales that allow people with disabilities to be weighed when they go to the doctor. You can see [these rules at ADA.gov](https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-08-08-mde-fact-sheet/). 
- Led the award-winning redesign of [ADA.gov](https://www.ada.gov/) to help people with disabilities, businesses and state and local governments understand their rights and responsibilities under the ADA in everyday situations.
