## Our mission

We alert, equip, and empower the public to influence the federal policies that shape their lives.{.font-size-lg}

{% include "logo-divider.html" %}

## Who we are

Public Powered Policy was founded by former leaders of the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division. 

We served together in the Disability Rights Section — the office responsible for enforcing and strengthening the civil rights of people with disabilities nationwide.

We didn’t just study federal rulemaking. We lived inside it.

At DOJ, we were responsible for developing and implementing major civil rights regulations that affect millions of people’s daily lives, including:

- A rule requiring state and local government websites to be accessible, so people with disabilities can use the internet to vote, apply to college, follow civic events, and stay informed about what’s happening in their children’s schools.
- A rule requiring medical diagnostic equipment to be accessible, covering exam tables, weight scales, mammography machines, and more — ensuring that people with disabilities can receive basic medical care, including being weighed at the doctor’s office.
- The award-winning redesign of ADA.gov, transforming it into a practical, plain-language resource used by people with disabilities, businesses, and governments to understand their rights and responsibilities in everyday situations.

You can find these rules and related resources at [ADA.gov](https://www.ada.gov/).

Through this work, we saw how the federal rulemaking system is supposed to operate — and how often it doesn’t. Too frequently, large corporations and industry groups dominate the process, pushing agencies to write rules that serve them, even when those rules fail the public.

## Why now?

When we left the government, we didn’t leave our mission behind.

We are seeing powerful efforts underway to shrink public participation, rush harmful rules through, and bury ordinary people under technical language and opaque procedures. When the public is locked out, rights are quietly weakened and accountability disappears.

Public Powered Policy exists to reverse that trend.

## What we do

We use our insider experience to spotlight attempts to undermine public protections, and we translate the rulemaking system into clear, practical tools that make it possible for anyone — not just lawyers and lobbyists — to participate.

Because your voice belongs in the rules that govern your life. And when the public shows up, the system works better for everyone.
