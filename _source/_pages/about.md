## Our mission

## Who we are

Public Powered Policy was founded by former leaders of the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division. 

We served together in the Disability Rights Section — the office responsible for enforcing and strengthening the civil rights of people with disabilities nationwide.

We didn’t just study federal rulemaking (aka policymaking). We lived inside it.

At DOJ, we were responsible for developing major civil rights rules that affect millions of people’s daily lives, including:

- A rule requiring state and local government websites to be accessible, so people with disabilities can use the internet to vote, apply to college, follow civic events, and stay informed about what’s happening in their children’s schools.
- A rule requiring medical diagnostic equipment to be accessible, covering exam tables, weight scales, mammography machines, and more — ensuring that people with disabilities can receive basic medical care, including being weighed at the doctor’s office.

We also transformed [ADA.gov](https://www.ada.gov/) into a practical, plain-language resource so that people with disabilities, businesses, and governments could understand their rights and responsibilities.

Through this work, we saw how federal policies _should_ be made — with your input. Too frequently, large corporations and industry groups dominate the process, pushing agencies to write rules that serve them, even when those rules fail the public.

## Why now?

When we left the government, we didn’t leave our mission behind.

We are seeing powerful efforts underway to shrink public participation, rush harmful rules through, and bury ordinary people under technical language and opaque procedures. When the public is locked out, our rights are weakened and accountability disappears.

Public Powered Policy wants to reverse that trend.

## What we do

We use our insider experience to spotlight attempts to undermine public protections, we explain federal policymaking (aka rulemaking), and we highlight why it matters to you. We also provide you with the practical tools you need to participate.

Your voice belongs in the policies that govern your life. And when the public shows up, the system works better for everyone.
