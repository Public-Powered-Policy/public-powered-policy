## How to submit your first comment

So you know a rule that you want to comment on. Maybe you heard about it on the news, social media, or a podcast and you have something to say about how it would impact you and the world around you. Excellent. Welcome! Anyone can and should comment!

Commenting is key. Your comments can help hold the government accountable, change federal policy, and stop the government from taking actions that can harm you. Use your voice. 

And, don’t panic! This guide clearly explains how to: 
 
- Find a rule you want to comment on
- Submit a comment on a rule 

It also addresses some questions you may have about submitting comments.

Just remember, commenting is important, and we’ll make it easy!

{% accordion "Step 1: Find the rule", "step-1", 2 %}

{% processlist %}
  {% processitem "Go to <a href='https://www.regulations.gov/'>regulations.gov</a>." "" "h4" %}
  {% processitem "Search for the rule you are looking for using keywords." "You can refine your search by: <ul><li>agency</li><li>date of publication</li><li>type of document</li></ul><p>Refining your search will help make sure you have the right one.</p>" "h4" %}
  {% processitem "Only show documents open for comment." "If you know the comment period is open, select: “Only show documents open for comment”." "h4" %}{% image "refine-document-results.png", "Screenshot of Refine Document Results with a checkbox selected for Only show documents open for comment" %}
{% endprocesslist %}

_You can also find and read a rule on [federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/), but you'll need to go to [regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/) to submit your comment._
