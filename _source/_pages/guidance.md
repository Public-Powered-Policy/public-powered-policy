## How to submit your first comment

So you want to comment on a rule—also called a federal policy. Maybe you heard about it on the news, from a friend, on social media, or on a podcast. The rule affects your life or the world around you — and you have something to say.

That’s exactly how this is supposed to work. Welcome. Anyone can comment, and your voice truly matters.

{% include "logo-divider.html" %}

Commenting is one of the simplest ways to hold the government accountable. It can shape federal policy and help prevent harmful decisions — sometimes in ways that really do make a difference.

And don’t worry — you don’t need any special training to get started.
 
This guide will walk you through how to:

- Find the rule you want to comment on
- Submit your comment

We’ll also answer some common questions along the way.

Just remember: this process belongs to you, and we’re here to make it easy.

**One quick note about language:**
You may hear rules called “proposed rules” or “draft rules.” That just means they aren’t final yet. On this page, we’ll use the word _rule_ to keep things simple.

{% accordion "Step 1: Find the rule.", "step-1", 3 %}

{% processlist %}
  {% processitem "Go to <a href='https://www.regulations.gov/'>regulations.gov</a>." "" "h4" %}
  {% processitem "Search for the rule you are looking for using keywords." "You can refine your search by: <ul><li>agency (e.g., DOJ for the Department of Justice or HHS for the Department of Health and Human Services)</li><li>the date the rule was published (the “date of publication”)</li><li>type of document (e.g., proposed rule)</li></ul><p>Refining your search will help make sure you have the right one.</p>" "h4" %}
  {% processitem "Only show documents open for comment." "If you know the comment period is open, select: “Only show documents open for comment”." "h4" %}
{% endprocesslist %}

_You can also find and read a rule on [federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/), but you'll need to go to [regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/) to submit your comment._
{% endaccordion %}

{% accordion "Step 2: Check when comments are due.", "step-2", 3 %}
    {% processlist %}
    {% processitem "Many rules have 30- or 60-day comment periods." "Submit your comment before the deadline — late comments are not always considered." "h4" %}
    {% processitem "If you need more time..." "Submit a comment asking the agency to extend the deadline as soon as possible. Because they might not grant it, try to submit your comment by the original deadline if you can." "h4" %}
    {% endprocesslist %}
{% endaccordion %}

{% accordion "Step 3: Learn about the rule.", "step-3", 3 %}
    {% processlist %}
    {% processitem "Get a sense of what the rule covers." "If it has many parts, figure out which ones matter most to you so you can focus your comment." "h4" %}
    {% processitem "Don’t worry if you can’t read the whole rule." "They are often long, dense, and hard to understand." "h4" %}
    {% processitem "To get oriented, you can:" "<ul><li>Start with the rule’s executive summary.</li><li>Look for fact sheets or plain-language explainers from the agency or third parties.</li><li>Use AI to help summarize the rule (just remember that AI can make mistakes).</li><li>Read comments others have submitted to get ideas for what to say or how to say it. You can find these in the “Comments” tab on regulations.gov.</li></ul>" "h4" %}
    {% endprocesslist %}
{% endaccordion %}
{% accordion "Step 4: What to say — use what you know.", "step-4", 3 %}
    {% processlist %}
    {% processitem "Focus on how the rule affects you and your community." "Be specific. Tell the agency what should change and why it matters." "h4" %}
    {% processitem "Your comment doesn’t need to sound legal or formal." "Even a short paragraph can make a difference." "h4" %}
    {% processitem "You can submit anonymously." "You do not have to include your name." "h4" %}
    {% processitem "You can use AI to help draft your comment." "Just double-check it so it’s accurate and reflects what you want to say." "h4" %}
    {% endprocesslist %}

{% endaccordion %}
{% accordion "Submit your comment — you’re almost done!", "step-5", 3 %}
    {% processlist %}
    {% processitem "Go to your rule on regulations.gov." "" "h4" %}
    {% processitem "Find the comment button." "Select the “Comment” button to go to the comment form." "h4" %}
    {% processitem "Write your comment." "Write your comment in the text box or upload a document." "h4" %}
     {% endprocesslist %}

**Remember: you can comment anonymously.**
Do not include personal information (like your date of birth) or confidential business information. Your comment may be publicly viewable.
{% endaccordion %}

{% accordion "Step 6: Follow the rule and stay involved.", "step-6", 3 %}

<p>Check whether the agency extends the comment period or asks for more input.</p>
<br>
<p>After the comment period closes, the agency reviews the comments and may change the rule.
It then usually issues a final rule that responds to major themes raised in the comments.
Sometimes the agency may withdraw the rule entirely.</p>
<br>

**To stay up to date, you can:**
- Set a search alert for the rule.
- Check federalregister.gov for updates.
- Follow news sources or podcasts — especially where you first heard about the rule.
