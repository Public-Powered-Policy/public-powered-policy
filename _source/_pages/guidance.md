## How to submit your first comment

So you know a rule that you want to comment on. Maybe you heard about it on the news, social media, or a podcast and you have something to say about how it would impact you and the world around you. Excellent. Welcome! Anyone can and should comment!

Commenting is key. Your comments can help hold the government accountable, change federal policy, and stop the government from taking actions that can harm you. Use your voice. 

And, don’t panic! This guide clearly explains how to: 
 
- Find a rule you want to comment on
- Submit a comment on a rule 

It also addresses some questions you may have about submitting comments.

Just remember, commenting is important, and we’ll make it easy!

{% accordion "Step 1: Find the rule.", "step-1", 3 %}

{% processlist %}
  {% processitem "Go to <a href='https://www.regulations.gov/'>regulations.gov</a>." "" "h4" %}
  {% processitem "Search for the rule you are looking for using keywords." "You can refine your search by: <ul><li>agency</li><li>date of publication</li><li>type of document</li></ul><p>Refining your search will help make sure you have the right one.</p>" "h4" %}
  {% processitem "Only show documents open for comment." "If you know the comment period is open, select: “Only show documents open for comment”." "h4" %}
  {% image "refine-document-results.png", "Screenshot of Refine Document Results with a checkbox selected for Only show documents open for comment" %}
{% endprocesslist %}

_You can also find and read a rule on [federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/), but you'll need to go to [regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/) to submit your comment._

{% accordion "Step 2: Check when comments are due.", "step-2", 3 %}
    {% processlist %}
    {% processitem "Many rules have 30- or 60-day periods." "" "h4" %}
    {% processitem "If you need more time..." "Submit a comment asking the agency to extend the deadline as soon as you can. Because they might not grant it, try to submit your comment by the deadline." "h4" %}

    {% processlist %}

    {% processitem "Don’t worry if you can’t read the whole rule!" "Rules are often long and dense and sometimes seem to be designed to be hard to understand." "h4" %}
    {% processitem "To help you get a sense of what’s in the rule, you could:" "<ul><li>Start by reading the rule's executive summary.</li><li>Check if there are any fact sheets or plain-language explainers that the agency or a third party have published about the rule.</li><li>Consider using AI to help summarize the rule for you if you are comfortable (just remember, AI sometimes makes mistakes).</li></ul>" "h4" %}
    {% processitem "Look at comments that other people and organizations have submitted." "That may give you ideas for what to say or how to say it. You can find these in the comments tab on regulations.gov.

    {% processitem "Your comment doesn’t have to be written like a legal brief or even a formal letter." "Even a short, one-paragraph comment can make a difference." "h4" %}
