## You should have a say in the federal policies that shape your life.

{% include "logo-divider.html" %}

Federal policies impact everyday life — from the safety of the air we breathe and the healthcare we receive to how our schools operate and our civil rights are protected. And you have the power to shape them. Yet most people never hear about these policies until it’s too late to influence them.

A healthy democracy depends on public participation. But too often, the people most affected by federal policy are shut out, while powerful industries dominate the process. Increasingly, agencies are rushing major policies forward making it even harder for the public to weigh in.

That’s why Public Powered Policy exists.

We explain federal policymaking (aka rulemaking) and highlight why it matters to you. We provide you with practical tools so that you can show up, speak out, and protect your rights — no law degree required.

**Your voice is more important than ever.**
